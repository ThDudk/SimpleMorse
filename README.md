# MorseCode
 
Small web project for learning morse code. The website provides a user interface for inputting morse code. It then converts it to both english and standard morse code text. 

The editor follows International Morse Code (to the best of my ability). Of course, I know very little about morse code so I can't guarantee it's 100% accurate. 

The project additionally has a beginner mode, which allows users to input letters and words at their own pace, and delete the previous character if neccessary. This is mean't to allow users to build muscle memory for individual characters before they're ready to go non-stop.

Anyways, enjoy!
